Project Name: Exploring the Economic Impact of Recessions in the last 100 Years

Project Intro:
Many are looking to past financial crises to help make sense of what we’re currently experiencing with the Covid-19 fallout. Looking to the past could help us predict possible economic outcomes from the current aftermath. We’ll investigate how the recent financial crisis of 2008 impacted various metrics such as income, inflation, and personal expenditures. We’ll also look at Great Depression data to determine the time frame of personal income recovery.  

Project Objectives:
Specific questions we’re looking to answer in this research include the following:
-How did personal consumption expenditures fluctuate during the most recent financial crisis of 2008 nationwide and in Illinois?
-Are there any noticeable recovery trends in average personal income across the U.S. for the two specific economic crises (Great Depression and Financial Crisis of 2008)?
-How did inflation rates fluctuate in the past 25 years?

Resources : 
	Bureau of Economic Analyses – U.S. Department of Commerce (API)

Methods Used:
Inferential Statistics
Data Visualization
etc.

Technologies:
Python
Pandas, jupyter
etc.

Project Description:
API Data Hurdles:
-Finding and scouring 60 page documentation to find the data tables in the data set that we selected
-Selecting an API that we know how to consume (XML  JSON)
-Transforming JSON into a Data Frame
-Cleaning the data and transforming into numeric data for plotting

CSV Data Hurdles:
-Copying a data table from a website
-Transforming it into a CSV via excel
-Converting into a numeric
-Converting to a Data Frame and plotting

Process and plots: Please look at Presentation pwoer point file in this Project repository.


Summary/What We Learned

-The key takeaway from this research is that economic crises have noticeable impact on important measures such as income and consumption expenditures. When people are spending   money, the economy tends to flourish, but when they hold back the economy tends to contract.

-Personal consumption expenditures dropped in 2008, both nationwide and in Illinois.

-Looking at 90 years of data showed that average personal income has been on a consistent upward trend. However, personal income dropped in 2008 and took 6 years to return to the trend line.

-Income recovery during the Great Depression took even longer to recover than the 2008 financial crisis, roughly 10-11 years. During those years, world war II occurred, and we invested in infrastructure which sowed seeds to build the economy.

-Average inflation was negative in 2009 which is typical of weakened economy.
